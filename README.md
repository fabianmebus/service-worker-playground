# Service Worker Playground

**CAUTION:** 
* This implementation is NOT extensively tested in major browsers or with many devices!
* The JS should be compiled to an older ES version to get a better browser support!   

---

Right now the Service Worker in `service-worker.js` has just **one** purpose:
 
**Serve a styled HTML (offline) page on any HTML request if the network connection isnâ€™t working.**

## Tips for Service Worker Development

* There are a lot of caching strategies, decide up front what do you really want to accomplish. Have a look at the [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/).
* Know your browser (different manual reload options) and your browser dev tools.
* It definitely helps to have at least a basic understanding of HTTP caching, here you have [a good article from Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/).
* Switch off HTTP caching completely, for all (!) resources, with the HTTP header `Cache-Control: no-store` for instance. 


* Switch on HTTP caching and test your desired behaviour (again)
