# Service Worker Playground

**CAUTION:** 
* This implementation is NOT extensively tested in major browsers or with many devices!
* The JS should be compiled to an older ES version to get a better browser support!   

---

Right now the Service Worker in `service-worker.js` has just **one** purpose:
 
**Serve a styled HTML (offline) page on any HTML request if the network connection isnâ€™t working.**

## Tips for Service Worker Development

* There are a lot of caching strategies, decide up front what do you want to accomplish. Have a look at the [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/).
* Know your browser (different manual reload options) and your browser dev tools.
* Have a basic understanding of HTTP caching, here you have [Caching best practices & max-age gotchas by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/).
* Switch off HTTP caching completely, for all (!) resources, with the HTTP header `Cache-Control: no-store` for instance. 
* A Service Worker comes with a performance cost (bootup time) at first, see [Speed up Service Worker with Navigation Preloads](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload).
* Be aware of the "waiting phase" for the installation of a new version of your Service Worker, read [The Service Worker Lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#skip_the_waiting_phase).
* Make sure that only the requests you need (as less as possible) are handled by your Service Worker.  
* Make sure that only the resources you need (as less as possible) are cached by your Service Worker.
* Do not try to cache non-GET requests.
* HTML request and non-HTML requests usually need different treatments.
* Use `cache: 'reload'` for the requests of the resources you want to cache to bypass the HTTP cache, like in `new Request('/offline.html', {cache: 'reload'})`.
* Do not forget to update your Service Worker as soon as you updated cached resources.
* Start with a static cache name (e.g. "offline") which is not changed for every new Service Worker installation.
* Switch on HTTP caching again and test your desired behaviour (again).
